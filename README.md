# PROJECT: Investigating the contrast in results between students of different education levels.

## ABOUT 
In this project, the difference in the mock grades of Digital Support Services T-level students that do and do not have a passing computer science GCSE will be highlighted, understood and reasoned with.

## QUESTION
The question that will be answered through the completion of this project:
- "How does having a passing computer science GCSE affect a students results and performance in a digital support services t-level?"

## DATA REQUIRED
- The GCSE grade of the student with a computer science gcse
- The grade of the t-level mock the computer science GCSE student achieves
- The grade of the t-level mock the student without a computer science GCSE achieves

Also, the mock should be the first mock that they ever do, since the knowledge of the two students will become smiliar further into the course.

## HYPOTHESIS
The student with a computer science GCSE may find it easier to learn things because some content in the digital support services t-level are also taught in GCSE.
So, the likely outcome is that the student with the mentioned GCSE will aquire a higher grade than the latter.
